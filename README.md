# Narmin01-Data-Analysis
In this project, I analyze a mock betting platform dataset to showcase my data analysis and visualization skills.  The analysis focuses on user demographics, betting behavior patterns, and the impact of bonus strategies, resulting in data-driven business insights and recommendations.

## Power BI Dashboard
- Tool: Power BI
- File: Daily Betting Insights Dashboard.pbix
- Focus: User behavior, betting trends, bonus effectiveness

## Short Summary & Recommendations
The analysis of user behavior and betting activity revealed several non-obvious insights:
1. Bonus usage is strongly linked to higher engagement – users who received bonuses placed significantly more bets and had higher overall stake volumes. However, not all bonuses were fully utilized, suggesting room to optimize bonus allocation strategies.
2. Bonus efficiency varies – while many users use the bonuses, the return on bonus bets differs widely. Some users convert bonuses into substantial winnings, while others show minimal return.
3. Less active users tend to be older and use non-mobile devices – indicating a possible opportunity to increase engagement through device-specific or age-targeted campaigns.
 
## Business Recommendations
* Focus bonus campaigns on younger users and mobile users, who tend to engage more and demonstrate better bonus utilization rates.
* Segment users by bonus efficiency and consider offering higher-value bonuses to those with a proven ability to convert them into profitable outcomes.
* Launch reactivation offers for low-activity users (especially desktop users) with simpler and more guided bonus offers to drive activity.
